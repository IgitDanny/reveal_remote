# Reveal Remote

Reveal Remote is a simple tool that you point at a reveal.js presentation.
It will tell you where to point your phone so that it can control the presentation
via websockets

# How to Install
```$
npm install -g reveal_remote
```

# How to Use
```$
reveal_remote my_presentation/
...presentation ready please go to http://{device_ip}:{special_port}
```

Next, point your phone's browser to the ip address and port specified and you'll see a set of
arrows you can use to navigate around the presentation.
